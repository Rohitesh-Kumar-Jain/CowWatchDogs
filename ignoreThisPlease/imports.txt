// UserMixin Class

Flask-login requires a User model with the following properties:

    has an is_authenticated() method that returns True if the user has provided valid credentials
    has an is_active() method that returns True if the userâ€™s account is active
    has an is_anonymous() method that returns True if the current user is an anonymous user
    has a get_id() method which, given a User instance, returns the unique ID for that object

UserMixin class provides the implementation of this properties. Its the reason you can call for example is_authenticated to check if login credentials provide is correct or not instead of having to write a method to do that yourself.
